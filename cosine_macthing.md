in #resume-job-matching script


🟢 What I’ve Achieved

I wrote a script that:
Converts text to embeddings (vectors)
Computes cosine similarity between your resume and each job
Ranks jobs by semantic similarity
Prints the results in order
This is the core engine behind many real-world job matching systems!


🧠 Why Each Part Matters
Embeddings: Capture the “meaning” of text, not just keywords.
Cosine Similarity: Measures how close two meanings are, regardless of length.
Ranking: Lets you see which jobs are most relevant, not just which share keywords.


Semantic search lets us match jobs and resumes by meaning, not just keywords. The database efficiently finds the closest matches, and the ranking reflects real-world relevance.
