LangGraph is an open-source orchestration framework for building modular, multi-step AI workflows. It lets you define, visualize, and manage complex pipelines—like your job matching system—using a graph-based approach.


What is LangGraph Orchestration?
Orchestration:
It’s the process of coordinating multiple steps (nodes) in a workflow, handling dependencies, retries, and data flow.
LangGraph:
Lets you define each step (e.g., fetch jobs, parse resume, match, notify) as a node in a graph.
You connect nodes to specify the order and logic.
Handles errors, retries, and branching.
Makes your pipeline modular, maintainable, and easy to visualize.


Why Use LangGraph?
Modularity: Each step is a reusable function/node.
Visualization: You can see your workflow as a graph.
Error Handling: Built-in support for retries and error paths.
Extensibility: Easy to add new steps or change flow.
Production-Ready: Works well with Docker, cloud, and modern deployment.
